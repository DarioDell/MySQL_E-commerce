# MySQL_E-commerce

Evaluation of a set of tables that refer to a fictitious store that sells miniature products art crafts that are scaled down models of real life objects such as cars, motorcycles, airplanes, boats, etc.<br>
The concept of the project is to present various requests made in SQL, which enables to get rather useful and detailed information on the environment, products, clients, and the business economy.<br>
The different tables have been procured from Kaggle:<br><br>
- Customers
- Employees
- Orders
- Offices
- Order details
- Product
- Produc lines
- Payments
- Waregouses <br>
The analysis is performed in MySQL in conjunction with a Jupyter Notebook Python script. Python is not crucial in this project, but I have incorporated it to illustrate how seamlessly you can integrate Python and MySQL.<br>
The queries are made in the SQL language within MySQL and then I do the same in Jupyter Notebook where I get the results of each query that will be shown below in HTML format.<br>
